In chapter one, the main topic is chloroform, the chapter follows Frederic Mors, an olderly in a nursing home. He used chloroform to efficiently killed his patients/victims, he was told by the superintendent of the nursing home to commit these murders. The carbon, hydrogen and chlorine that mixed together to make Chloroform started to artract more killers. Albert Patrick and Charles Jones conspired and succeeded in killing millionaire William Rice using Chloroform.  Thanks to a crooked and drunken coroner system many people got off easy or in some cases, away with these Chloroform killings. In chapter two of the poisoners handbook "Wood Alcohol"  , was a silent killer. In the streets of New York it claimed the lives of many civilians. Doctors were used to alcohol poisoning at thaat time. The liquor produced in hidden stills frequently came tainted with metals and other impurities which made this outbreak bizarrely different. Cyanide was yet another effective killer on the innocent and unsuspecting victims in New York during the 1920s-30s. It landed more bodies in the examination rooms of detectives and scientist. Families, children of all ages, nobody was safe from this new poison that dominated New York city.
